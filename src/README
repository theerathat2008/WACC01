OVERVIEW OF IMPLEMENTATION
----------------------------

The implementation of the project relies on antlr4.7 generating the Visitor classes from the Lexer and Parser grammar files.

The generation of the AST Tree which is the internal representation of the input program is done in one parse of the
visitor function.

The syntactic analysis is done by antlr relying on the rules defined in the grammer files.
The semantic analysis is done in the waccVisitor class in the check function of the AST Nodes as they are generated.

Files and directories
----------------------------

> waccTest class <

This class creates the compiler by implementing antlr functions to generate the ParseTree.
At this point syntactic analysis is done and if there are errors, they are printed out and the program exits.

The waccVisitor is then instantiated and the AST parse tree is generated here.

> waccVisitor class <

The waccVisitor class has visitor functions for all the alternative labels from the Parser grammar file.
There are two generic templates for the visitor function.
1. The Non-Terminal Node has the structure:
    - Create the corresponding AST Node for the current visitor function
    - Set the current created AST Node as an embedded AST Node of the parent node if neccessary
    - Set the syntactic string member variable of the current node if neccessary
    - Set the ParentNode variable of the current AST Node
    - Set the member variable of the waccVisitor class which is parentVisitorNode to be the current AST Node
    - Carry out semantic anaylsis on the current node if necessary
    - Print out a debug statement
    - Visit the rest of the children nodes

2. The Terminal Node has a similar structure bar the fact that instead of visiting the children nodes,
   the parentVisitorNode will cycle up the AST Tree via accessing the ParentNode variable until it reaches
   a AST Node which has not filled its current sub-tree.


> ASTNodes directory <

The abstract AST Node class has member variable parent Node which represent the AST Node directly above the current
node in the AST Tree. It also has getters and setters for the member variables of its sub-classes for both the embedded
AST Nodes and the syntactic string member variables.

There are also helper functions such as isEmbeddedNodeFull which aid in the construction of the tree through the visitor
pattern and a print function which helps in debugging the tree.

The structure of the AST class node inheritance is as follows:

AST_Node -> AST_FuncDecl
         -> AST_Keyword
         -> AST_Param
         -> AST_ParamList
         -> AST_Program
         -> AST_Separator
         -> AST_Expr       -> AST_ExprArrayElem
                           -> AST_ExprBinary
                           -> AST_ExprEnclosed
                           -> AST_ExprIdent
                           -> AST_ExprLiter
                           -> AST_ExprUnary
         -> AST_Stat       -> AST_StatAssign
                           -> AST_StatBeginEnd
                           -> AST_StatExpr
                           -> AST_StatIf
                           -> AST_StatMult
                           -> AST_StatRead
                           -> AST_StatVarDecl
                           -> AST_While
                           -> AST_StatAssignLHS   -> AST_StatArrayElemLHS
                                                  -> AST_StatIdentLHS
                                                  -> AST_StatPairElemLHS
                           -> AST_StatAssignRHS   -> AST_StatArrayLitRHS
                                                  -> AST_StatCallRHS
                                                  -> AST_StatExprRHS
                                                  -> AST_StatNewPairRHS
                                                  -> AST_StatPairElemRHS
         -> AST_Type       -> AST_ArrayType
                           -> AST_BaseType
                           -> AST_PairType
                           -> AST_PairElemType    -> AST_ArrayTypePair
                                                  -> AST_BaseTypePair
                                                  -> AST_PairString


The non-terminal classes (Base classes) in the inheritance structure are used as holders for their subclasses.
